# Project: Identify Customer Segments
## Project Motivation

In this project, I will apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. 

## File Description

The data that I will use has been provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics. <br>

>Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb: analysis report <br>
>Data_Dictionary.md: explains the data columns and variables within the columns fully <br>

Unfortunately the data I used is proprietary and I'm not allowed to share it. <br>

## Results
The target audience is mainly male (ANREDEKZ: 1.0), with a high income (FINANZ: 1.0-2.0), who are single or are a couple (LP_LEBENSPHASE_FEIN: 20.0, 13.0). <br>

The unpopular audience is mainly male/female (ANREDEKZ: 1.0, 2.0), with a lower income (FINANZ: 5.0-2.0), who are of retirement or late age (LP_LEBENSPHASE_FEIN: 11.0, 12.0). <br>
