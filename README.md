# Python-Unsupervised-ML
# Project: Identify Customer Segments
In this project, I will apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that I will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task. In real-life tasks, there may be many valid ways to approach an analysis task. One of the most important things you can do is clearly document your approach so that other scientists can understand the decisions you've made.

The file "Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb" shows my analysis, unfortunately the data I used is proprietary and I'm not allowed to share it. The file "Data_Dictionary.md" will explain the data fully so you can follow my analysis and conclusions.
